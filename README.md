#Hypothesis : (my experience) it's (a problem) (that's ill-defined), and (impossible to solve). -@CuriousDan
#Quandry: #Define the #Diff between #experience & #Assumption 
#Definition: #Diff =~ #DifferentThan #Experience
#PJ: Experience is hard to define.  I know that. That's what I've been trying to define. My Hypothesis is the #NonpareilQuotient = #Relevency #Luck #Experience 
What values go between those and what quality they have are "up for debate" until we get more data.  Once we know more people's #Jargon, and can break them down to their #Thought, We can give an #Approximation of their #Intent.

The things that matter in this algorithm are #Id, #Avatar, and #Assumptions. Your #Avatar (Production Product) ( #Load) is  the result of your #Id modified by your #Assumptions (or #Approximations). Your #Approximations are SUM( #Experiences). That #Assumption is the unknown. So we write a language to remove #Assumption. If we do that, we get closer to the #id and not the #Avatar. In Psychology, we're hearing from your true self instead of the person you want to be or think you are. In computers, we're bringing the compute layer to the data and minimizing the threads and interuptions between them. In terms of a language, it's a how an #Idea  becomes a #thought and what happens between that and #Jargon. The #diff is #Assumption. The modification that happens because of the #experiences you've had. Once you've given your #Jargon ( #assumed #intent), the other side of the #ETL. The #Entity you are trying to #Educate takes your #Jargon, applies their #Assumptions, and then #reads your #intent. That's not fair to you. That's not fair at all. #Assumptions are where arguments happen. They're where people get offended. It happens because people don't understand the intent of the words you said. So "Speak from your heart" : #Educate from #id to #id. Or as close as you can. So there's less room for #assumptions.

#Hypothesis: #id -> #Assumption -> #Jargon -> #Jargon -> #Assumption -> #id 
If we can remove the difference in #Jargon. OR #Quantify the #diff. We can remove #Assumption ... #id -> #id .

What #experiences have I had such that I can design this model? This is engineering. #ETL. The T is DevOps. I was the DevOps Architect for the #Education Authoring Platform. So I studied all of it. A lot. If the Developers are the #id (raw code) my job is to get them to the #Avatar (production) as efficiently as possible and with as few #assumptions as possible. And I have to #iterate on that #automation until I find raw #automation. The speed at which I experience things in this aptitude/vertical is faster than most. That's my #Nq for this specific aptitude/vertical. Everyone has verying levels of #Nq at this specific thing. My #Nq that was required to be a #PJ in the Airforce (spec ops bad ass) wasn't high enough for #NonpareilSuccess. Same with many other times I've failed . So I've tried to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing. In order to do that, I had to map out who I am at the #id. I'm working on it. I just started writing this Friday. I'm #Disambaguating #Theories of people that have gone down these roads before me and then updating them based on my #Assumptions and claiming them to be a #Hypotheis . Challenging everyone (Open Source) to #Contribute to my #Hypothesis. So we can #Transform those #Hypothesis into #Theories and then #Laws using raw #Scientific #Theory. 

This is very emotional for me. I am mapping my #id . I'm making it #OpenSource and I've created a #Contribution #Model. I have to think as stream of conciousness in order to remove #assumption. Raw #id. I've defined enough of a language to do that. And as I find words that aren't defined, I'll add them to the language. But I think I have enough for a contribution model. Now I want everyone to define their #Jargon. Their layer of #CSS that they on their #id. If they can do that, we can bridge any language barriers. Any #Jargon barrier. We can ignore #assumptions. Or at least understand them by #quanitifying them to within an #StandardDeviation. The #Outliers are our #NonpareilEvents that define our #NonpareilExperiences. The cornerstones of who we are. #Create #Outliers . They #Educate the most #Efficiently  ~ Malcolm Gladwell (That's not his quote, just my summation of his books)
