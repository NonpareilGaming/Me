## Motivation

I love watching streamers try and analyze a game. I think they all have different opinions based on their experiences. I first came up with this idea while playin NBA2K23, so I will use teh big players in the analytic streamer space to decsribe my plan.
	
## Problem Satement

Every few weeks, 2kTutes and 2kLabs come out with a video on each badge. They then give their tier list for each of the badges. I believe 2kTutes has a better data model but I also prefer 2kLabs for their homepage. So I, like many gamers, watch both. I think analyze their analysis and decide who I think is right. I tend to think LakerFan makes builds that aren't for me. They're full slasher builds and I tend to stay away from that. But I do believe he's a very talented slasher. So when he put out his layup package, I immediately went to watch. In my mind, he's has top end slashing **EXPERIENCE**. So if I want to watch a video on slashing, I'll go to his page. But at the same time, I've known people in the comp community that disagree with his testing theories. It may not be that his information gained from testing is wrong. But that the method isn't necessarily indicitive of gametime situations. So someone like 2k_rec_warrior who makes videos nearly exclusively in the rec, may be a better example of someone that you want to listen to for slashing rec advise.

## Solution

I am not nearly arrogant enough to believe that I can answer those questions correctly. So we must build a community that can determine for the community as a whole who's right. We will Open Source a webpage that is ultimately a framework for any game. It can work in Overwatch just as well as it does in 2K. BUT, I know the 2K game much better. So I will continue to focus on 2K first. Once that is done, or even in parallel, I invite anyone to help me build these same models for other games.

# Entities

Each game, gamer, community... microservice, is a entity. Treat them as facts, because they are data model. These databases may end up being openly available. They don't have the logic.
TODO

# Logic

Logic is the inersect between Opinion and Theory. If your opinion in logical, it is a theory.


# Theory
Theory is an opinion backed by logic. Every gamer has their theories. This is what our datapoint is, this is what we're keeping safe. 

# Gamers (Nonpareil Gamers Contribute!)

Gamers are people who are interested in playing games. No further definition. They're all welcome. Free pages all around! (SSO through Google/Facebook/etc.). Each gamer can build their profile, upload clips from Xbox, and play **rating games** to rate their favorite parts of each game. Each gamer will have a profile game as their first rating game. This will determine their profile.

# What makes you think this will work?
In college at UNCW, I wrote a paper and built an algorithm for predcitions based on exisitng data. The model failed, and I still got an A+. #NonpareilEvent Failure is part of the process. If you never fail, you'll never know your limits. #NonpareilQuote : "Fail fast, iterate efficiently"
